## Other Teams Ground Control Software
* Look at the ground control software that other teams have used in the past through the [AUVSI SUAS website](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/competitions/2017/).

* These are the teams that built their own custom ground control softwarE:
  * 2nd Place: [Cornell's custom ground control software](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/static/competitions/2017/journals/auvsi_suas-2017-journals-cornell_university.pdf) is on page 7.
  * 10th Place: [BYU's custom ground control software](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/static/competitions/2017/journals/auvsi_suas-2017-journals-cornell_university.pdf) is on page 8.
  * 11th Place: [Alberta's custom ground control software](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/static/competitions/2017/journals/auvsi_suas-2017-journals-university_of_alberta.pdf). See pages 9, 10, 16.
  * 15th Place: [A school from Karnataka, India](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/static/competitions/2017/journals/auvsi_suas-2017-journals-ms_ramaiah.pdf). See pages 12, 13-14, 17.
  * All other schools mainly uesd either QGroundControl or Mission Planner.

## Inspirations for points
* For cyber security we can include mandatory account login if we are making our ground station through the web - it will ask for username and password.
